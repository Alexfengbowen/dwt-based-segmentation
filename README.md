# Discrete Wavelet Transform based Segmentation of Trajectories
This repository implements the procedure from Soleymani et al. (2017) for applying a DWT-based segmentation on trajectories of turkey vultures in R.

* See [here](https://munterfinger.github.io/dwt-based-segmentation/) for the R code and a detailed description.
* See [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12755/abstract) for the original MatLab version.
