# Discrete Wavelet Transform based Segmentation of Trajectories
This repository implements the procedure from Soleymani et al. (2017) for applying a DWT-based segmentation on trajectories of turkey vultures in R.

See https://munterfinger.github.io/dwt-based-segmentation/ for the R code and detailed description.
